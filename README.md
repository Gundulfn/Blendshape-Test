# Blendshape-Test

This project is about Blendshape feature in Unity. Blendshape is used for mesh deformation(Example: Facial expressions, muscle movement) according to a float value in "SkinnedMeshRenderer" component. You can add Blendshape feature on model in 3D modelling softwares likes Maya, Blender etc.

NOTE: Blendshape should be only use for small mesh deformations, not for scaling model or its Armature(This can cause errors on model's animations, in this project I used Blendshape for model scaling and it distrupted animations because of armature's size and model's size differency).
