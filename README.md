# Blendshape-Test

This project is about Blendshape feature in Unity. Blendshape is used for mesh deformation(Example: Facial expressions, muscle movement) according to a float value in "SkinnedMeshRenderer" component. You can add Blendshape feature on model in 3D modelling softwares likes Maya, Blender etc. If you want to see project's example video, you can check my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/burak-can-ciftci_unity3d-blender3d-activity-6948234650712444928-uvoo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) or you can download "BlendshapeVideo.mp4" in the project.

NOTE: Blendshape should be only use for small mesh deformations, not for scaling model or its Armature(This can cause errors on model's animations, in this project I used Blendshape for model scaling and it distrupted animations because of armature's size and model's size differency).
